## Enabling Side-Streams (run in parallel):

- **Continuous Innovation** – horizon-scanning, test-and-learn backlog
- **Partnership Development** – media-owner & tech-vendor ecosystem
- **Client Engagement** – QBRs, roadmap workshops, ongoing comms
- **Finance & Billing** – PO management, media payments, revenue recognition

That's the full end-to-end framework we'll use as the backbone for more detailed process maps.
